# UFOs

## Overview

After originally building a webpage chronicling UFO sightings, we sought a way to make it more dynamic by offering multiple search criteria.  In our updated wepage, we wanted to give users the ability to filter on five different table filters.  In addition to the existing date filter, the filters we were looking to add were city, state, country and shape.


## Results

The webpage has successfully been updated to now include the five requested table filters.  As you see below, we've added the four additional filters under the date filter that was previously created, and included placeholder text so that the users have an idea of how to search through the table

We removed the need for the user to hit the button in order to apply the filter.  Now the filters will be applied as soon as the user enters the filter criteria and hits enter.  The below image shows the result if a user were to search for all UFO sightings in the state of Oregon.

The filters are dynamic enough, that if the user then wanted to filter down to see only those sightings that occurred in Oregon on January 12th, they could then add the date filter along with the state fitler and just get the two results of the sightings that occurred in Oregon on January 12th.  To clear the filters, the user will once again select the 'UFO Sightings' link at the top of the page which will reset the original table.

## Conclusion

One drawback to this webpage is that the user is only able to filter on one instance of each filter field.  For example, a user would not be able to filter on a date range, or filter on all the states that are on the west coast.  One suggestion to make this an even more dynamic search filter is to add this capability.  Give the users the capability to select multiple states, or multiple dates to enhance their user experience.  Another suggestion for improvement is to create a 'Refresh' button to clear the filters and reset the table.  It's not completely intuitive to have to select 'UFO Sightings' each time a user wants to refresh the table, so I think clearly laying out the ability to 'Refresh' will go a long way to improve the user experience.
